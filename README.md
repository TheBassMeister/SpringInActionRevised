# SpringInActionRevised
This project is mainly the code from Craig Wall's great book Spring in Action (https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-fifth-edition) with some minor improvements
As I am working through this book I encountered some issues in some chapters that didn't work properly in 2020. The code here might help some of you who are working with this book and might get stuck. Additionally I tried to add some improvements, like improving the taco cloud here and there.
If you wonder about how the code works and what all these annotations mean, go get and read Spring in Action.
